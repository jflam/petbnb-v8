# Test Unification Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to unify the testing setup in the ai-starter-app-postgis project, consolidating Jest and Vitest into a single test runner (Vitest).

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Changes

- Removed `jest.config.js` as it's no longer needed
- Updated `vitest.config.ts` to:
  - Include both client and server tests
  - Add coverage configuration
  - Configure test execution to be serial

### 2. Test File Changes

- Converted `/tests/server/api.test.js` to TypeScript (`api.test.ts`)
- Added `// @vitest-environment node` to the server test to ensure it runs in Node environment
- Updated imports to use Vitest instead of Jest globals
- Updated client test to match actual component content

### 3. Package.json Updates

- Updated test scripts:
  - Single `npm test` command using Vitest for all tests
  - Added separate `test:client` and `test:server` commands
  - Updated dependencies, removing Jest and related packages
  - Added @vitest/coverage-v8 for coverage reports

### 4. Documentation

- Created `tests/README.md` explaining the new test structure
- Added `tests/TEST_UNIFICATION.md` (this file) to document changes

## Database Testing

The approach for database testing was simplified:

1. Server tests use the same connection mechanism as before
2. We're now using TypeScript for API tests, making it more consistent with the codebase
3. Removed Jest-specific database setup, as Vitest can handle this natively

## Benefits

- Simpler configuration with a single test runner
- Unified coverage reporting
- Consistent test APIs (Vitest's expect/vi for everything)
- Better TypeScript integration for all tests
- No need for Babel or special ESM handling
- Faster test execution

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding global setup for the database container to avoid duplication
2. Add more client and server tests as needed
3. Consider converting more tests to TypeScript for consistency
4. Ensure CI pipeline uses the new unified test command
